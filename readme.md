# Subsystem Analysis
___

***currently in an experimental state.***

## Overview
This is intended to be a system for analyzing sub-systems, with first robot design in mind.The idea is to be able to create sub-systems by adding parts that are needed to create the sub-system. Analysis can be done to determine sub-system weight, cost, etc. Also want to be able to tie into an inventory management system so purchase decisions can be made.

### Goals
 - [ ] model atomic parts
 - [ ] building sub-assemblies
 - [ ] Inventory management
 - [ ] sub-assembly creation UI
 - [ ] atomic part creation UI
